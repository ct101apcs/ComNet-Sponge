Solo portion:

1. I am already successful in performing solo tesing, which sends a 1-MB-sized file to the server and receives it back.

2. The identicality of the sent and received file is verified by comparing the SHA256 hash of both files.

3. No code changes required for this portion.

Group portion:
1. We test the group functionality by sending a 1-MB file to the server and my partner receives it back.

2 & 3. Our implementations ensure that the file is sent and received correctly, with the SHA256 hash of both files being identical. In addition, there is a small insight captured, that if we try sending from the client port to the server port, it still works but the transfer rate is much slower than sending from the server port to the client port.

Creative portion (optional):
